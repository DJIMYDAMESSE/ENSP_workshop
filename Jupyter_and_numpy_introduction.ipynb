    "\n",

    "Once you have installed Anaconda, then there are several ways to run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```Jupyter Notebook``` will be listed as a program in the list of Windows programs. In Windows you can search for \"Jupyter Notebook\" and run it from there. \n",
    "* You can run Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator. However, this is very slow and not recommended. It's better to run Jupyter Notebook directly.  \n",
    "* Alternatively, you can open an ```Anaconda Prompt``` as a Windows program and then type in ```Jupyter Notebook``` at the prompt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(When you install Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook will be set to run with Python.  Note that it is also possible to run other languages in Jupyter notebook, such as ``R`` or ``Julia``. These may be installed using the Anaconda Navigator.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Run Jupyter notebook online:** There are several cloud servers that will run Jupyter notebooks.  The most popular is _Google Colab_  \n",
