    "This tutorial has two parts. The first part shows how to do a correlation analysis in Python. In particular, we will investigate correlations between the 3 features (measurements) made with water as solvent and similarly between the features with methanol as solvent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part shows how to use thresholds for classification. We can attempt to do a binary classification based on one feature by setting a threshold: if the feature value is below the threshold, we choose one class, and if the feature value is above the threshold, we choose the other. If we use more than one feature, we can extend this idea and set different thresholds for different features. Since we have lots of computing power, we can explore all different combinations of thresholds and pick out the best one for our purpose.\n",

    "- A statistical method which is often used to determine the degree of linear dependency between pairs of variables. \n",
