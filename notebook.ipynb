It is known for its kernel trick to handle nonlinear input spaces. It is used in a variety of applications such as face detection,  intrusion detection, classification of emails, news articles and web pages, classification of genes, and handwriting recognition.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will be using scikit-learn in Python. If you would like to learn more about this Python package, I recommend you take a look at our [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn) course.\n\nSVM is an exciting algorithm and the concepts are relatively simple. The classifier separates data points using a hyperplane with the largest amount of margin. That's why an SVM classifier is also known as a discriminative classifier.

It can easily handle multiple continuous and categorical variables. SVM constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes. SVM generates an optimal hyperplane in an iterative manner, which is used to minimize an error.  The core idea of SVM is to find a maximum marginal hyperplane(MMH) that best divides the dataset into classes.\n\n![](graphics/svm.png)\n\n#### Support Vectors\n\nSupport vectors are the data points, which are closest to the hyperplane. These points will define the separating line better by calculating margins. These points are more relevant to the construction of the classifier.\n\n#### Hyperplane\n\nA hyperplane is a decision plane which separates between a set of objects having different class memberships.\n\n#### Margin\n\nA margin is a gap between the two lines on the closest class points. This is calculated as the perpendicular distance from the line to support vectors or closest points. If the margin is larger in between the classes, then it is considered a good margin, a smaller margin is a bad margin.\n","metadata":{},"id":"9df73888-16fa-4e37-b105-7a520ff705f4","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## SVM Kernels\n\nThe SVM algorithm is implemented in practice using a kernel. A kernel transforms an input data space into the required form. SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick. Here, the kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. In other words, you can say that it converts nonseparable problem to separable problems by adding more dimensions to it. It is most useful in non-linear separation problem. Kernel trick helps you to build a more accurate classifier.\n\n* **Linear Kernel**\nA linear kernel can be used as normal dot product any two given observations. The product between two vectors is the sum of the multiplication of each pair of input values.\n\n```\nK(x, xi) = sum(x * xi)\n```\n\n* **Polynomial Kernel**\nA polynomial kernel is a more generalized form of the linear kernel. The polynomial kernel can distinguish curved or nonlinear input space.\n\n```\nK(x,xi) = 1 + sum(x * xi)^d\n```\n\nWhere d is the degree of the polynomial. d=1 is similar to the linear transformation. The degree needs to be manually specified in the learning algorithm.\n\n* **Radial Basis Function Kernel**\nThe Radial basis function kernel is a popular kernel function commonly used in support vector machine classification. RBF can map an input space in infinite dimensional space.\n\n```\nK(x,xi) = exp(-gamma * sum((x â€“ xi^2))\n```","metadata":{},"id":"1b8400be-2e39-4de2-8b95-e7d976742d32","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"\nHere gamma is a parameter, which ranges from 0 to 1.

There are various types of functions such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF). Polynomial and RBF are useful for non-linear hyperplane. Polynomial and RBF kernels compute the separation line in the higher dimension. In some of the applications, it is suggested to use a more complex kernel to separate the classes that are curved or nonlinear. This transformation can lead to more accurate classifiers.\n* **Regularization**: Regularization parameter in python's Scikit-learn C parameter used to maintain regularization. Here C is the penalty parameter, which represents misclassification or error term. The misclassification or error term tells the SVM optimization how much error is bearable. This is how you can control the trade-off between decision boundary and misclassification term. A smaller value of C creates a small-margin hyperplane and a larger value of C creates a larger-margin hyperplane.\n* **Gamma**: A lower value of Gamma will loosely fit the training dataset, whereas a higher value of gamma will exactly fit the training dataset, which causes over-fitting. In other words, you can say a low value of gamma considers only nearby points in calculating the separation line, while the a value of gamma considers all the data points in the calculation of the separation line.","metadata":{},"id":"comic-evening","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Advantages\n\nSVM Classifiers offer good accuracy and perform faster prediction compared to NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm.
